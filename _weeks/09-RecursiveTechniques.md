# Mandatory videos

Watch this video before class. It is the best video on solving problems recursively that I have ever seen. Most of you should have encountered the concept of recursion before, but it is a challenging concept, and understanding it is essential for understanding dynamic programming (which we will cover next week). When I have taught this material in the past, I wasn't sure that spending a day reviewing recursion was necesary. However, I found that even after doing so, many students still struggled with it. So please, take this material seriously and make sure you understand it.
